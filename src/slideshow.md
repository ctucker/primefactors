# Prime factors

Quick number theory refresher..

* Every positive integer has a unique *prime factorization*
* The *prime factors* of a number is the list of prime numbers that,
  multiplied together, exactly equal that number
* For example:
  * 2 = 2
  * 3 = 3
  * 4 = 2 x 2
  * 12 = 2 x 2 x 3
  * 15 = 3 x 5
  * 360 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 5

# Test-first factorization

* For the next 10 minutes, write out test cases you think will be
  interesting
* Couple of ideas to start:
  * Think small: simplest possible cases
  * Expand to more complex cases later
  * Don't forget error handling...

# Discussion

* What did your tests look like?
* Did the algorithm "grow" naturally or did it need to be written and replaced
  repeatedly as you covered new tests?
* Can you understand the code without the tests?
* Can you understand the tests without the code?
* What is performance like?
